    <h1>CSS Layout - The position Property</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>The <b>position</b> property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute or sticky).</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>The position Property:</h3>
    <p>The <b>position</b> property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.</p>
    <p>There are five different position values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>static</li>
        <li>relative</li>
        <li>fixed</li>
        <li>absolute</li>
        <li>sticky</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the 
    position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>position: static:</h3>
    <p>By default, HTML elements are positioned with static.</p>
    <p>Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left or right properties.</p>
    <p>An element with <b>position: static</b> is not positioned in any special way; it's alwats positioned according to the normal flow of the page.</p>
    <div class="divStatic">
        <p>This is a static div.</p>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <h3>position: relative:</h3>
    <p>An element with <b>position: relative;</b> is positioned relative to its normal position.</p>
    <p>Setting the top, right, bottom and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
    Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
    <p>Below, the div is relatively positioned, with the left property set to 40px.</p>
    <div class="divRelative">
        <p>This is a relatively positioned div.</p>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <h3>position: fixed:</h3>
    <p>An element with <b>position: fixed;</b> is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place regardless if the page is scrolled or not.
    The top, bottom, right and left position are used to position the element.</p>
    <p>Fixed positioned elements do not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. The example is in the top right.</p>
    <div class="divFixed">
        <p>This div is fixed to the top right.</p>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <h3>position: absolute:</h3>
    <p>An element with <b>position: absolute;</b> is positioned relatively to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned
    relative to the viewport, like fixed).</p>
    <p>However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>
    <p>A thing to note is a positioned element is one where the position is anything except <b>static</b>.</p>
    <div class="divRelative2">
        <p>This is a relative div.</p>
        <div class="divAbsolute">
            <p>This is an absolutely positioned div in a relatively positioned div.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <h3>position: sticky:</h3>
    <p>An element with <b>position: sticky;</b> is positioned based on the user's scroll position.</p>
    <p>A sticky element toggles between <b>relative</b> and <b>fixed</b>, depending on the scroll position. It's positioned relative until a given
     offset position is met in the viewport, then it sticks in place like <b>position: fixed</b>.</p>
    <p>One thing to note is this is a new property, so IE/Edge 15 and earlier versions don't support it. If a site needs to support older browsers this may not be suitable.</p>
    <div class="divSticky">
        <p>This is a sticky positioned element.</p>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Overlapping Elements:</h3>
    <p>When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.</p>
    <p>The <b>z-index</b> property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others.</p>
    <p>An element can have a positive or negative stack order.</p>
    <div class="divRelative2">
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <img class="overlap" src="1.gif" width="100" height="140">
        <p>This is a paragraph which is above the image.</p>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Positioning Text in an Image:</h3>
    <div class="divRelative3">
        <h4 class="centered">Centered</h4>
        <h4 class="topLeft">Top Left</h4>
        <h4 class="bottomRight">Bottom Right</h4>
        <img class="textPosition" src="2.jpg" alt="Italy">
    </div>
