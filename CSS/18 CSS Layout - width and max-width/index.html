    <h1>CSS Layout - width & max-width</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>As mentioned in the previous entry; a block-level element always takes up full width available to it.</p>
    <p>Setting the <b>width</b> of a block level element will prevent it from stretching the full width of its container.</p>
    <p>With this and setting the margins to auto, the element can be centered while taking up the specified width, and remaining space can split between the two margins.</p>
    <div class="centeredDiv">
        <p>This div element has a width of 550, with a margin set to auto.</p>
    </div>    
    <p>By using <b>max-width</b>, it will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is imported to make a site more usable on smaller devices. See example below on browser resize.</p>
    <div class="centeredMaxDiv">
        <p>This div element has a width of 550, with a margin set to auto.</p>
    </div>
