    <h1>CSS Psuedo Elements</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Psuedo-Elements:</h3>
    <p>A CSS psuedo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.</p>
    <p>Ways it can be used are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To style the first letter or line of an element.</li>
        <li>To insert content before, or after, the content of an element.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h3>The ::first-line Psuedo-Element:</h3>
    <p>The <b>::first-line</b> psuedo-element is used to add a special style to the first line of text.</p>
    <p>Below shows the first line of text in all p elements with the class <b>firstLine</b>formatted.</p>
    <p class="firstLine">The first line psuedo-element can be used to add effects to the first line of text. But because this may be displayed on wide monitors, there needs to be lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of text so that it spans over at least two lines. If this text gets too long for smaller sceens then this may be a lot of text.</p>
    <p>One thing to note is this can only be applied to block level elements.</p>
    <p>Below are properties that apply to the <b>::first-line</b> psuedo-element:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>font properties</li>
        <li>color properties</li>
        <li>background properties</li>
        <li>word-spacing</li>
        <li>letter-spacing</li>
        <li>text-decoration</li>
        <li>vertical-align</li>
        <li>text-transform</li>
        <li>line-height</li>
        <li>clear</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One thing to notice is that in <b>psuedo-elements</b> there are two colons, such as <b>::first-line</b>, whereas psuedo-classes have a single colon, such as <b>:first-line</b>.</p>
    <p>The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for psuedo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between psuedo classes and elements.</p>
    <p>Prior to CSS3, the single colon was used for both classes and elements.</p>
    <p>For backward compatibility, the single colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 psuedo-elements.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>The ::first-letter Psuedo-Element:</h3>
    <p>The <b>::first-letter</b> psuedo-element is used to add a special style to the first letter of a text.</p>
    <p>Below the shows the first letter being formatted to all <b>p</b> elements with the class <b>firstLetter</b>.</p>
    <p class="firstLetter">The first letter has been styled.</p>
    <p>To note, like the <b>::first-line</b> element, <b>::first-letter</b> can only be applied to block-level elements.</p>
    <p>The following properties that apply to the <b>::first-letter</b> are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>font properties</li>
        <li>color properties</li>
        <li>background properties</li>
        <li>margin properties</li>
        <li>padding properties</li>
        <li>border properties</li>
        <li>text-decoration</li>
        <li>vertical-align (only if <b>float</b> is set to <b>none</b>)</li>
        <li>text-transform</li>
        <li>line-height</li>
        <li>float</li>
        <li>clear</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Multiple Psuedo-Elements:</h3>
    <p>Several psuedo-elements can also be combined.</p>
    <p>Below, the first letter of a paragraph will be yellow, with a font size of 2em. The rest of the line will be blue, in small caps. The rest of the paragraph will be the default font size and colour.</p>
    <p class="multiplePsuedo">The first letter of this paragraph will be yellow, with the font size set to 2ee. The rest of the first line is set to be blue and in small caps. The rest of the paragraph has been not been altered so will have the same font family, colour and size.</p>

    <hr/>
    <h3>The ::after Psuedo-Element:</h3>
