    <h1>CSS Text</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Text Colour:</h3>
    <p>The color property sets the colour of the text. The colours can be set in the ways shown in previous entries.</p>
    <p>The default text colour for a page is defined in the body selector. I've set it to a dark grey.</p>
    <p class="colourYellow">I have yellow text.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Text Alignment:</h3>
    <p>The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of text.</p>
    <p>Text can be aligned to the left or right, centered or justified.</p>
    <p class="alignLeft">I am left aligned.</p>
    <p class="alignCenter">I am center aligned.</p>
    <p class="alignRight">I am right aligned.</p>
    <p>When text-align is set to 'justify', the line will be stretched so everything is equal width. The margins will have equal width, like in newspapers.</p>
    <p class="alignJustify">I am a justified text block so my I will fit each line equally. This sentence does have to be very long for it to span the page, however. It's best to have this property set in small containers of text where it'll be of more use.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Text Decoration:</h3>
    <p>The text-decoration property is used to set or remove decorations from text. Setting this property to none will remove all decorations, mainly for removing underlines on links.</p>
    <a class="decorationNone" href="#">I am a link with no decoration.</a>
    <p>The other values to decorate text are shown below:</p>
    <p class="decorationOverline">I have text decoration set to overline</p>
    <p class="decorationLineThrough">I have text decoration set to line-through</p>
    <p class="decorationUnderline">I have text decoration set to underline</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Text Transformation:</h3>
    <p>The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowecase letters in text.</p>
    <p>This can be usedto turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalise the first letter of each word.</p>
    <p class="transformUpper">I have uppercase text.</p>
    <p class="transformLower">I HAVE LOWERCASE TEXT.</p>
    <p class="transformCapitalise">the first character of each word has been capitalised.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Text Indentation:</h3>
    <p>The text-indent property is used to specify the indentation of the first line of a text. Which can sometimes be useful for things like articles.</p>
    <div class="smallContainer">
        <p class="textIndentation">Here I've got a bunch of text and the first line has been indented by 50px.</p>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Letter Spacing:</h3>
    <p>The letter-spacing property is used to specify the space between the characters in text.</p>
    <p class="spacingWide">I have wide letter spacing.</p>
    <p class="spacingNarrow">I have narrow letter spacing.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Line Height:</h3>
    <p>The line-height property is used to specify the space between lines.</p>
    <p class="heightTall">This has a high line height.</p>
    <p class="heightTall">This has a high line height.</p>
    <p class="heightShort">This has a short line height.</p>
    <p class="heightShort">This has a short line height.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Text Direction:</h3>

    <hr/>
    <h3>Text Shadow:</h3>
    <p>The text-shadow property adds shadow to text. Each property accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text.</p>
    <p>The values accepted by the property are:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><b>none</b> - This is the default value, being no shadow.</li>
        <li><b>initial</b> - This set the property to its default value.</li>
