    <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The CSS Box Model is used when talking about design and layout in HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>The Box Model is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>margins</li>
        <li>borders</li>
        <li>padding</li>
        <li>content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below is a visual representation taken from W3.</p>
    <img src="1.JPG" alt="Box Model">
    <p>How the box model is made and works is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Content</b> - This is where anything such as text, images and general content will go.</li>
        <li><b>Padding</b> - This is the area that surrounds the content, within the border, which is transparent.</li>
        <li><b>Border</b> - This is what surrounds the padding and/or content. It can have many styles as per previous entries.</li>
        <li><b>Margin</b> - Clears an area outside the border, this too is transparent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The box model allows many layers of border that can be utilised in many ways and is a good way to remember what does what when working with all the properties within the model.</p>
    <div class="boxModel">
        <p>I am an example box model.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Width & Height of an Element:</h3>
    <p>By understanding the box model, it allows for the knowledge of the width and height of an element with the addition of padding, border and margin.</p>
    <p>The total element width is calculated as: left and right padding, plus left and right border, plus left and right margin.</p>
    <p>The total element height is calulated as: top and bottom padding, plus top and bottom border and plus top and bottom margin.</p>
